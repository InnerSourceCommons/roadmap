# InnerSource Commons Foundation Public Roadmap

## Our Mission
We empower developers and organizations to apply open collaboration principles in their daily work. As the neutral hub and central collaboration space for InnerSource knowledge, we maintain our independence and operate on a lean budget while building a strong, inclusive community and industry partnerships.

## RISE - Our Strategic Goals for 2025
Our roadmap is aligned with our RISE strategy:

### R - Reach New Industries and Regions

Reach New Industries and Regions: Establish organized, purposeful outreach programs to specific industry subgroups.
We will create, fill, and grow a structure and program for how to integrate InnerSource among existing industry practice areas (e.g. open source, agile, devops, developer experience, platform). Goals in these areas could be things like ensuring that we show up at relevant conferences, connect with key influences in the industry practice, publishing on how the practice area relates to InnerSource, etc. We will similarly support and organize around InnerSource in specific regional and/or language groups (e.g. Japan, China, Brazil, Africa, etc). Goals for these areas could include hosting local, in-person gatherings, translating InnerSource Commons materials, ensuring that InnerSource shows up at regional and language conferences, etc.

### I - Implement Specific Documentation

Specific documentation on InnerSource
We will publish more-detailed, quality documentation on specific challenges or confusions that we see on InnerSource in the industry. In this effort, we move past high-level guides and directional pieces but get specific as to how InnerSource can actually work in real situations. Whitepapers, blog articles, and guides cover topics such as: definition of InnerSource, qualitative benefits of InnerSource, ROI of InnerSource, AI and InnerSource, transfer pricing, governance, maturity model, pitch deck, etc.

Two adjacent goals support these principal goals and the InnerSource Commons in general.

### S - Summit Success

Global, In-Person InnerSource Summit 2025
In the year of the 10th anniversary of the formation of the InnerSource Commons, we will hold an in-person summit instead of the virtual event that weâ€™ve seen post-pandemic. Organizations will be invited to apply to host the summit.

### E - Establish Brand Consistency

Brand Consistency through the Brand Guide
We will create, document, and share visual and stylistic branding guidelines for the InnerSource Commons. We will bring all current assets in-line with the guidelines and plan so that future publishing follows them.
